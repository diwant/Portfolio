<p><em>and I want to lead your J2EE team.</em>  My experience is in the major J2EE frameworks, with a strong emphasis on proper MVC code.  I have lead an offshore team in development of a Struts2/Hibernate web application for two years.  I have extended the Eclipse Plugin Framework to make pluggable components game engine as a hobby.  Additionally, I understand the motivations that divide the Java community among the different frameworks available and I know the strengths of the big ones like Struts and Seam.</p>
<p>If you have a position as a Java/J2EE team lead or developer for me, <strong>send me an email</strong> at <a href="mailto:diwant@gmail.com">diwant@gmail.com</a> (or you can click on my name up top), and tell me more about the application you want to build.  I'll take it from there.</p>
