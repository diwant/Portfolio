<p><em>and I want to lead your C++ team.</em>  For five years I developed and taught strongly object oriented C++.  When developing in C++ my focus is on small, easy to digest objects and behavior functions.  This is because I have used open source C++ code and I understand the need to make my code easy for other developers to follow.</p>
<p>If you have a position as a C++ team lead or developer for me, <strong>send me an email</strong> at <a href="mailto:diwant@gmail.com">diwant@gmail.com</a> (or you can click on my name up top), and tell me more about the application you want to build.  I'll take it from there.</p>
