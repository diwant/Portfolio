<p><em>and I want to make your web application.</em>  For seven years I have made beautiful, simple websites and web apps because of a deep seated interest in technology and design. My goal with every site I make is to make the experience seamless and easy for the viewer.</p>
<p>To see if I should be the one to make your web application, <strong>the first step is to send me an email</strong> at <a href="mailto:diwant@gmail.com">diwant@gmail.com</a> (or you can click on my name up top), and tell me more about the web application you want to build.  I'll take it from there.</p>
